# Disposable

This Repository is for providing a brief explanation on how to setup disposable development and red/blue team virtual environment. I will provide a rundown on how I created the Vagrant Base image, as well as a Vagrant file so that you can pull down the base image that I created, and use your own.

## Requirements

* Basic understanding of Linux
* Install VirtualBox
* Install Vagrant
* Patience
